    <h1>Drunk Driving Awareness</h1>
    <h2> Sarah Arzberger</h2>
    <p>An important topic that is very close to my heart is drinking and driving. I believe as a college student it is important to bring awareness of what can happen when you drunk drive. Not only are you putting your life on the line but others are either in the car with you or around you. Drunk drivers cause more than 17,000 deaths annually. This equates to 310 funerals each week or one death every 30 minutes. Being a young adult, who travels all around the city, especially going to college, and seeing people make terrible decisions is just very heartbreaking.   

    The story I am going to tell is a true experience. I grew up in a family full of alcoholics and being only 10 at the time I didn't really understand how important it is not to drink and drive. I thought it was something normal, until one night. My younger brother and I were with my Uncle and my cousins in our summer home in Upstate NY. We went to an end-of-summer party and my uncle and cousins got extremely drunk, the worse I have ever seen it. I had a feeling something was wrong but there was no way I could get my brother and me home without us getting into a car with them. The drive was only 20 minutes away but it felt like hours. Long story short my uncle thought it would funny to turn off his headlights on a very dark mountain road and he moved into the other lane with incoming traffic and we smashed into a tree. Thank God no one was hurt but ever since that day I could never get in the car with someone who had been drinking. </p>
