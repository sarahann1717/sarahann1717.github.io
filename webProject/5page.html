     <h1> How My Life Changed</h1>

     

     <p> Back in 2017 I was not the same person that I am now. Coming to church really saved my life and made me and has gotten me where I am today. I would not have met any of my amazing friends if it wasnt for the Rock. This is something that I hold very close to my heart becasue growing up I didnt have family, I was bullied in school. My life was headed in a very dangours and dark path. But then I met Abraham and he showed me the church everything chnaged and light was brought into my life. A couple of years later, I then found Shirley and showed her the church. It was a simple chain reaction and the pattern is still going. Forever grateful :) <p>
