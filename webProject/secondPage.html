          <h1> My Friend Shirley</h1>

          <p> This is Shirley. We are actually roomates. We meet back in 2018 in the Queen Center Mall, I gave her a flyer inviting her to my church. I had no idea that she would become my closest friend and even more my roomate. We are each others halfs and I feel like I have known her my whole life. We have been through the good and the bad but I am very grateful to call her my sister and friend.</p>
