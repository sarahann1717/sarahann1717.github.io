         <h1> A Look Into My Life</h1> 

       
         <p> Just like most people, they consider their friends to be their family. In my case<i> my friends are my family.</i> Without going into great detail my friends have made a big impact on my life and I am beyond grateful to have them in my life. This website is just a small glance into my life and my way of saying thank you for all that they do.</p>
